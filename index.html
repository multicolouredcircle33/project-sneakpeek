   <div class="paragraph-one">A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than researchers thought. NASA’s<p> Curiosity rover has been<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2197638-curiosity-is-entering-what-may-be-the-best-area-to-find-life-on-mars/"><span id="bodylink"> exploring Gale crater</span></a> for more than eight years, and while early observations</p><p> suggested the entire crater may once have been filled with water, a new analysis implies that it just had</p><p> a series of ponds instead.</p>
    <div class="paragraph-two"><p> Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a measure called the chemical index of </p><p> alteration to determine how rocks were weathered over time.<a href="https://www.clays.space/"><span id="bodylink"> Joseph Michalski</span></a> at the University of </p><p> Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because this measure was developed for use on</p><p> Earth, it may not be valid in the extreme Martian climate.</p></div>
    <div class="paragraph-three"></div><p> Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that are expected to change based on</p><p> different types of weathering over time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity examined</p><p> did interact with water at some point in their past, but more are likely to have formed outside of the</p> water.</div>

   <div class="paragraph-four">“Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that are demonstrably lacustrine<p> [formed in a lake] are the lower few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the</p><p> fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per cent.”</p>
    <div class="paragraph-five"><p> These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2271407-marss-crust-may-have-sucked-up-most-of-the-planets-water/"><span id="bodylink"> sediments in the crater</span></a>, suggesting the lake</p> <p> was not nearly as deep or extensive as we thought. “There was likely a </p><p> small lake or more likely a series of small lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.</p> </div>
    <div class="paragraph-six"><p> The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so Michalski says that they may have</p><p>formed out of ash from volcanic eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations</p><p>   by other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.</p></div>
